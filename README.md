# DJS01: My Podcast App

## Overview

I was instructed to  design and build a responsive web application that allows users to **browse podcast shows** on a landing page and **view detailed information** in a modal. The application should display clear, concise previews of podcast shows and offer additional information through a modal pop-up, **all without navigating away from the page**. My app should showcase clean code architecture and strong UI/UX design while following JavaScript best practices.

## Core Objectives
1. A landing page that shows preview of podcasts as cards where information can easily be viewed.
2. A modal that pops up when a podcast card is clicked on and displays longer information about that podcast.
3. A smooth running application that displays without issues.
4. Code that is neat and uses SOLID principles.
